Data Analysis on Coursera
-------------------------

In January 2013 I took the course on Data Analysis offered
by Jeff Leek on the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis)
platform. The homework consisted in  several quizzes and
two bigger assignments. For these two projects we were
asked to analyse some real data in R and submit them
for review by our peers (other students of the class).
