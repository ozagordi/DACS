Figure 1: The plot reports the value of the interest rate applied to borrowers as estimated from their FICO creditworthiness score and the amount requested (see model (1) in the text). The y-axis reports the interest rate of the loan, while the x-axis the amount requested. Different levels of FICO score, 640, 700 and 830, are represented by the sold black line, by the dashed red line and by the green dotted line, respectively. They represent the lowest, median and highest score observed. As an effect of the interaction between FICO and amount requested, the slope of the lines decreases with higher scores of creditworthiness.
